Lets write our first program. If you are reading this you have access to a browser and internet, which is all you are going to need for this first short tutorial.

Our friend Jimmy is looking to write a program, he doesn't know where to beging, but he knows what the out come should be.

Now that we know what he wants, lets outline what we will need.

* [x] Knows what he wants (display the phrase "Hellow World!" on a computer screen)
* [x] About writing a Python program
* [x] The online interpreter
* [x] Writing & Executing the program

## Jimmy's goal

He wants to display the following sentence **"Hello World!"** on a computer screen

> In Python the action of displaying any value to a device screen is refereed to as **"print"**

## About writing a Python program

Jimmy will need a place to write his first program, he could write it in a text file and save it, which is completely valid, but how would he make it run?

He needs a program that understand what he writes and does what he asks in the program

> In Python this is refereed to as an **"interpreter"** and what Jimmy writes is refereed to as **"instructions"** or **"code"**. After Jimmy writes his "code" he has to "make it work", that is refferted to as **excecuting the code**

### We need an interpreter to write the code

For this exorcise we will use an on-line Python **interpreter** so we don't have to download and install anything.

There are many **Online Python Interpreters** they are convenient if you want to write a quick program and test it, which is what we want to do.

As a programmer you will want to install the python interpreter in your system at some point.

We are going to use **[Trinket.io](https://trinket.io/embed/python3/c0a3e920df)** as our Online Interpreter, it is simple to use, reliable and popular. Open the link below in a different windown and place it side by side to the tutorial

* [Trinket.io](https://trinket.io/embed/python3/c0a3e920df)

### Simple instruction for using Trinket

* [x] Write code on the left side panel
* [x] Click on the run icon (top tool bar)
* [x] Results will display on the right side panel

## Writing & execute the code

* Type in all lower case the following command in the left panel.
  * `print("Hello World!")`
  * Press the **>Run** button on the top bar
  * On the right side panel notice the result of your program

> You did it, you printed the phrase **"Hello World!"** to a computer screen.

* The command `print()` in Python is called a **Function** or in this case a **built-in function** because it comes standard with Python and enables the programmer to cast to screen any message. In this case our message goes in quatations because we want to display exactly what we type.

* Anything in quotes is called a **String**, so **"Hello World!"** is refereed to as a string.

Now that Jimmy has written his first program, we can say it was relatively easy.

## Things to try

Now lets have you change Jimmy's message to one of your own. Remember since it is a **string** it needs to be in quotes

## A few questions

* The `print()` command is also reffered to as a?
* Any message in quotes is called what in python?
* Trinket is also knowned as a what?
