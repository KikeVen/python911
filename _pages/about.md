Welcome to Python 911, this blog is dedicated to Python basics mini-course. I hope to take a different approach to teaching Python to none programmers.

By introducing Python basics from the point of view of the student, with clear short term goals and specific action items, I hope to maintain the attention and ease learners into the world of computer programming using Python.

## This series will consist of

* Small size projects (10 to 15 minutes).
* Introduse programming vocabulary.
* Introduce Python as a general purpose programming language.
* Short summaries.
* Practice exercises.
* Action items for next lesson.

These tutorials are free of charge, please support my Patron account.
