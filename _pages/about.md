Welcome to python 911, this blog is dedicated to Python basic tutorials. I hope to take a different approach to introducing Python to none programmers.

By introducing Python basics from the point of view of the student, with clear short term goals and specific action items, I hope to maintain the attention and ease learners into the world of computer programming using Python.

## This series will consist of

* Small size projects (10:00 to 15:00 minutes)
* Introduse programming vocabulary
* Introduce Python as a general purpose programming language
* Short sumaries
* Practice exorcises
* Action items for next lesson/tutorial

These tutorials are free of charge, but any donations will be greatly appreciated. Feel free to donate through my Patron account.

Thank you for your time
