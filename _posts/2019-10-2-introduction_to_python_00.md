Because we are introducing Python with projects and examples, the scope may look narrow and somewhat out of 'traditional' order. This is taking a more practical approach to learning Python.

Each class will begin with a challenge, description, Python topics to cover, explanation and sample and lastly we solve the challenge.

Each lesson is relatively short, with purpose and a definite end. Each lesson builds on top of the one before, so it is important to keep sequence, as this is not reference documentation.

At the end of each Lesson, the challenge for the next lesson is introduced, followed by a section with exercises and questions.

In order to compleat the challenges, the scope is a bit more narrow than traditional more theoretical courses, every effort to keep the broadest scope possible is taken and to follow up with more explanations and traditional teaching as the course progresses.

The lesson titles are as follow, Lesson [number], [challenge name] (Python topics). Although the date on the page, will show you are going backwards, this is something to be changed in the near future, just keep track of your lesson number.

Lesson # | Challenge | Topics
---------|-----------|-------
Lesson_1: | Hellow World | (Trinket.io, print())
Lesson_2: | Temperature converter | (intergers, decimals, addition, multiplication, subtraction, order of operations)

Lesson_4: | Python Installation | (Python interpreter, IDLE, Intereactive Session, Win, Mac, Linux)
Lesson_5: | In review | (Data type, primitive, none-primitives, mutables, immutables, functions, keywords)

Lesson_7: | Letter grade mod | (if, Comparison operators, Boolean operators, Multiway branching)
Lesson_8: | Price list | (for/while loops, zip())
