Now that we have written our temperature converter script, we want to turn it into a small consul application for others to use. We need the following:

1. Display a message when the app starts
2. Collect temperature from the user
3. Temporarely store the collected value
4. Convert string to a float
5. Round the results

Before we can begin we have to review a few past coding concepts and introduce a couple of new ones.

* Strings
* Built-in functions like `print()`
* Variables (temporary value storage)

## Strings

During our first tutorial we talked a bit about strings. They need to be in quotations. But we can do a lot more with strings than just print them, more on that later. In this tutorial we are using strings to give instructions to the user through the `print()` function

* Strings are sequences of Unicode characters.
* Strings must be in single, double or at times triple quotes
* Strings can't be changed once set, making them **immutable**

There are three ways to represent string literals using quotes, the same  type of quotes must be use on both ends. If a string **begins** with double quotes `"` it **must end** with double quote `"`

* single quotes `'Hello World! - it is 45* outside'` - single line
* Double quotes `"Welcome to Python 911"` - single line
* Triple quotes `""" This represents multiple lines """` - multiple lines

Below we are asking Python to print the type of a given string, it returns `<class 'str'>` which stand for **string**

```python
>>> print(type('I am a string'))
<class 'str'>
```

The following would **cause a Syntax Errors**

``` python
>>> print('I'm a string')
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print('I'm a string')
             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

> When you add the apostrophe between the **I** and **m**, Python thinks that is the end of the string and anything after causes the error, since it doesn't know how to handle it

To fix this problem we can simply add double quotes at the beginning and end of string

``` python
>>> print("I'm a string")
# I'm a string
```

That is good for now, in later tutorials we will get in more depth with **strings** and **indexing**

## Built-in functions

Built-in functions are pre-written chunks of code which we can call at any time to perform a predetermen task.

* such as the `print()` and `type()` functions.
* We put information inside the parenthesis. That is referred to "passing parameters" to a function, such as the string or numbers we put inside the print function to disply the results on a screen.

```python
print("Wat time is it?")
```

When you pass a string to the print function, it executes the code associated with it and displays results on a screen.

They are called built-in because they come standard with Python

> Later we will write our own functions, they are an important part of programming and they can be very powerfull

For this tutorial we will use the following built-in functions

Function | Description
---------|------------
`print()` | Displays results to screen
`input()` | Is able to collect input from a user
`float()` | Specifies any number/string as a decimal
`round()` | Rounds to specified decimal place

## Variables (temporary values storage)

We would like to isolate the changing Fahrenheit number so it is easier to convert different numbers from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

* A temporary container in Python is called a **variable**
* We can **assign** different **values** to a **variable**.

> Lets say we have the temperature 75 degrees Fahrenheit and we want to assign it to a variable

* We will call our variable `f_temp`, representing "temperature in Fahrenheit"

```python
>>> f_temp = 75
```

* If we print `f_temp` we would get the value in return

```python
>>> print(f_temp)
75
```

> This can be red as: the value of 75 was assigned to the temp_f variable or the current value of temp_f is 75

We can write almost any variable name, there are a few restrictions:

* It is critical to note that Python has a variety of **reserved keywords** that **cannot be used** as variable names as they appear in the list below:

---|---|---|---|---
---|---|---|---|---
and | assert | break | class | continue | def
del | elif | else | except | exec | finally
for | from | global | if | import
in | is | lambda | not | or
pass | raise | return | try | while
yield |

A variable can have a very short name, such as `x` and `y` or a more descriptive name `age`, `name`, `product_id`

* They must start with a letter or an underscore
  * `x = 45`
  * `_y = 24`
* They must contain only letters, digits or underscores
  * (A-z, 0-9 y _)
  * `my_variable_A = 3456`

* A variable name can not start with a number

```python
9true_var = 45 # invalid
true9_var = 45 # valid
```

* Variable names are case sensitive `age`, `Age` and `AGE` are three different variables

```python
Age = 34
age = 40
AGE = 56
```

## Lets write our program

We are going to modify the program we wrote in the previous tutorial, but first lets start from the beggining.

### Welcome message and description

We first want to let our end user know what they are about to use and what it does.

* We will use the print function for this.
* Since it is a multiline string, lets use tripe quotes
* Lets also add some blank spaces to make it more legible

```python
print()
print("""*** Temperature converter 3000 ***
~ Easily convert Fahrenheit to Celsius ~""")
print()
```

> You can run the code above to see how it looks

### Assign input() function to a variable

Now that we have our welcoming message, we are going to ask the user to input the temperature they want to convert by using the input function, we also want to assign it to the variable `f_temp`

To use the input function all we have to do is pass the message we want displayed on screen and the function takes care of creating an input field for the user to enter the requested value.

Just below the message we wrote above we type the following

```python
f_temp = input('Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ')
```

if you run the code above you should get your welcoming message and you should be prompted to enter a temperature. 

As you enter the temperature it will assign it to the `f_temp` variable and do nothing. Notice how the `input()` function took care of displaying your message and collecting your value.

There is a problem, the `input()` function collects anything as a **string**, so a number is entered as a string. they look the same on screen but they are different **types**. We want a floating point number so it can be used in the equation later. Lets test it.

```python
>>> f_temp = input('Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ')
>>> print(type(t_temp))
<class 'str'>
```

### Convert string to a floating point number

Converting an **input string** into a **float** is pretty easy, all we have to do is place the `input()` function inside the `float()` function, when you enter a temperature it will be converted to a floating point number

> If you enter a character other than a number, say the word "no", it will return an error, `ValueError: could not convert string to float: no`. There are ways to handle errors, but we will do that later.

```python
>>> f_temp = float(input('Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: '))
>>> print(type(t_temp))
<class 'float'>
```

So far we have our message and input function assigned to a variable and should run without any errors.

```python
print()
print("""*** Temperature converter 3000 ***
~ Easily convert Fahrenheit to Celsius ~""")
print()

f_temp = float(input('Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: '))
```

### Using input value in our equation

We now have to do something with `f_temp`, we need to use it in our equation in order to convert it from Fahrenheit to Celsius

We want to begin by assigning our `f_temp` variable to our equation. It should look like this `(f_temp - 32) * 5/9`, where `f_temp` represnets the number the user enters

Lets also assign the equation to a variable named `converter` and then print the results.

```python
print()
print("""*** Temperature converter 3000 ***
~ Easily convert Fahrenheit to Celsius ~""")
print()

f_temp = float(input('Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: '))
converter = (f_temp - 32) * 5/9

print(converter)
```

### Using the round() function

When you run the code above it will execute properly, but most likely get a very long floating point number. More often than not we normally just want two decimal points. There is an easy way, by using the `round()` function.

* The round function takes a float and rounds it to a given decimal point. This function takes two parameters, the number and the number of decimal places we want to return.

* We use it by placing our equation inside the `round()` function, **followed by a coma** and the number of **decimal places** we want returned, in this case **two decimal points**.

* `round((f_temp - 32) * 5/9, 2)`

If you update your code it will run as we outlined it at the beginning

```python
print()
print("""*** Temperature converter 3000 ***
~ Easily convert Fahrenheit to Celsius ~""")
print()

f_temp = float(input('Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: '))
converter = round((f_temp - 32) * 5/9, 2)

print(converter)
```

> You did it, you wrote you first Python application-ish!

## Next tutorial

If you made it this far, you will probably want Python in your system. So the next tutorial will be about installation and setup

## Things to try

* Try using the round function in a different place and get the same results

## Question

* What is a built-in function?
* What are keywords in Python?
* When do you use the round() function?
* Is this `3_myvar` a valid variable? why?
