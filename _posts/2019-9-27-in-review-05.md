We have covered a few Python concepts by example, lets see how they relate to other componets and theire purpose, in hope you are able to see paterns in the design of Python.

Most of this paterns are transferable to other languages as they are programming principles.

These patterns allow use to search for answers more precisely as they form part of the Python lexicon and thus is what other programmers use when answering questions or the documentation uses to explain the language.

In this tutorial I am going to introduce three of these general concepts so we can start to think like programmers.

We are going to start with the three below.

* **Data Types:** intergers, floats, strings ...
* **Keywords (reserved):** in, True, False, None ...
* **Built-in functions:** print(), input(), round() ...

## Data Types

So far we have seen how **intergers**, **floats**, **strings** work in very general terms. We covered how to change a `string` to `float` in the "Temperature Converter" tutorial, we can reffer to that as **chaning object types**

We can see in the diagram below these data types fall under a category called **Primitives** and are **Immutable**.

* **Primitive Data Types** are the most basic form of data objects, simple data structures

* As the most simple data structure, they are **Immutable** because they can't be changed after they have been created.
 
* In other words, `5 is 5`, `5.2 is 5.2`, `'yes' is 'yes'` and `True is True` you can never overwrite the values of immutable objects. **We may make a copy** of an immutable and manipulated but never the original value

```python
>>> 'yes' is 'No'
False
>>> 'yes' is 'yes'
True
```

* We will introduce **boolean** at a later point as part of a project tutorial.

### We don't know what we don't know

Primitives are part of a larger family in Data Types. As you can see as there are **Primitives** there are **Non-primitives** and as there are **Immutables** there are **Mutables**

* More on these other types as we cover new projects in future Tutorials.

## Keywords

We had introduced the list of Python Keywords as a guide of words we can not use when creating variable names. But we didn't talk about its use.

|        |          |         |          |        |
| ------ | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| False  | await    | else    | import   | pass   |
| None   | break    | except  | in       | raise  |
| True   | class    | finally | is       | return |
| and    | continue | for     | lambda   | try    |
| as     | def      | from    | nonlocal | while  |
| assert | del      | global  | not      | with   |
| async  | elif     | if      | or       | yield  |

Keywords are reserved words in Python, these words have very specific uses. These are the only words that can be written with out quotes that Python will accept and understand without producing an error as in the example above. They define the syntax and structure of Python

As in the example above. the word `is` can be used to compare two objects and it will return a **boolean** response of `True` or `False`.

```python
>>> 'yes' is 'No'
False
>>> 'yes' is 'yes'
True
```

You can use the keyword `in` to find the presense of an object in another object

```python
>>> 'f' in 'aeiou'
False
```

These keyword in combination with variables and other Python componets allows use to write rich applications and what makes Python a **High Level Programming Language**

> From the example above we can see very clear what we want Python to do, "Is the letter f in the adjacent string?"

* As humans we see that code and might say "Is f a vowel?" which would be acceptable
* In Python or any other language we can not make that assumption, hint:

```python
>>> 'f' is 'F'
False
```

In Python the keyword `is`, is part of **comparison operations** and is use to identify and **object's identity**

> Now try to look for the definition of the keyword 'in' without context on the internet.

We will make more practical use of these keywords with more real world projects in upcoming tutorials.

## Built-in Functions

They are pieces of code when called perform a specific task or function, you can find them in almost all programming languages they might go by subrutines.

Python has about 70 built-in functions always available to the user, no need to import any modules, because they are part of the standard library they execute relatively fast.

* You can see a full list of all the built-in functions in the documentation

We can write our own functions, we actually turn the Temperature Converter into a function, we will do that later in a tutorial.

We already have used some built-in functions:

| Function  | Description                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `print()` | Prints a given Object           |
| `float()` | Returns a floating point number |
| `input()` | Reads and returns a string      |
| `round()` | Returns a float to ndgits place |

lets introduce a one more built-in functions

* `len()`: Returns lengnth of an Object

```python
>>> my_string = 'This is my string'
>>> len(my_string)
17
```

> It can be useful if a programmer needs a string not to exceed a certain number of characters, (spaces are characters too)

## Next tutorial

We are going to write a small application that will allow us to take the grades of a student and figure out the highest, lowest and average grade for the year.

## Things to try

Can you find out the following?

* From the list of built-in functions find use for one we haven't cover
* Change the Data Type of an `int` to a `str`

## Question

* What is the keyword `is` for?
* From the chart above what Object is **not a primitive**, but still **immutable**?
